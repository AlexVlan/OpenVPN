# ABout
There are two scripts in this repository, the first is create_openvpn_server_centos8_v0_3.sh. This script can install the OpenVPN server on the rhel family. This script was written by me. 
The second script has the name ubuntu20+_openvpn-install.sh. This script I took from the website https://github.com/angristan/openvpn-install. It is here so that I do not forget about it.

# INSTALL

```
sudo chmod  +x ./create_openvpn_server_centos8_v0_3.sh
